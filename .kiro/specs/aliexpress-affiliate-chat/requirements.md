# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A custom GPT-powered intelligent chat assistant that processes user requests, handles file and image uploads for context analysis, integrates advanced GPT logic with context memory, manages backend data securely, and delivers rich formatted responses. The system is designed as a modular platform that can be extended with additional features like API integrations and external services.

5. THE GPT_Assistant SHALL provide clarifying questions when user requests are ambiguous

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload files (documents, CSVs, JSONs) and images, so that the assistant can analyze and reference this content in responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file, THE File_Upload_Handler SHALL validate file type, size, and security
2. THE Content_Processor SHALL extract and index text content from documents, CSVs, and JSON files
3. THE Image_Analysis_Service SHALL process uploaded images for content extraction and analysis
4. THE Storage_Manager SHALL securely store uploaded files with proper access controls
5. THE GPT_Assistant SHALL reference uploaded content context in subsequent responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the assistant to provide rich, formatted responses that incorporate context from my uploaded files, so that I receive comprehensive and relevant answers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating responses, THE Response_Formatter SHALL create rich, formatted output with proper structure
2. THE GPT_Assistant SHALL incorporate relevant content from uploaded files into response context
3. THE Context_Memory_Manager SHALL maintain file-based knowledge across conversation sessions
4. THE GPT_Assistant SHALL cite specific sections or data points from uploaded files when relevant
5. THE Response_Formatter SHALL support markdown formatting, tables, and embedded media references

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure file storage and user authentication, so that uploaded content is protected and access is properly controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_Service SHALL validate user identity before allowing file uploads or access
2. THE Storage_Manager SHALL encrypt files at rest and implement access control policies
3. THE File_Upload_Handler SHALL scan uploaded files for malware and security threats
4. THE Storage_Manager SHALL implement file retention policies and automatic cleanup
5. THE Authentication_Service SHALL log all file access and modification events for audit trails

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling and performance optimization, so that the system remains stable and responsive under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file processing fails, THE Content_Processor SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. THE GPT_Assistant SHALL timeout long-running operations after 30 seconds to maintain responsiveness
3. THE Storage_Manager SHALL implement file size limits and quota management per user
4. WHEN external services are unavailable, THE GPT_Assistant SHALL provide graceful degradation
5. THE Context_Memory_Manager SHALL implement efficient caching to reduce processing overhead

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular architecture, so that new features like API integrations and external services can be easily added later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GPT_Assistant SHALL implement a plugin architecture for extending functionality
2. THE Content_Processor SHALL support pluggable file format handlers for different document types
3. THE Response_Formatter SHALL allow custom formatting modules for different output types
4. THE Storage_Manager SHALL provide abstracted interfaces for different storage backends
5. THE GPT_Assistant SHALL implement webhook support for external service integrations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast response times and efficient file processing, so that I can work productively without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE File_Upload_Handler SHALL process files asynchronously with progress indicators
2. THE Content_Processor SHALL implement parallel processing for multiple file uploads
3. THE GPT_Assistant SHALL provide streaming responses for long-form content generation
4. THE Context_Memory_Manager SHALL cache processed content to avoid reprocessing
5. THE Storage_Manager SHALL implement CDN integration for fast file retrieval

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and analytics, so that I can track system performance and user engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GPT_Assistant SHALL track conversation metrics, response times, and user satisfaction
2. THE File_Upload_Handler SHALL monitor upload success rates, file types, and processing times
3. THE Storage_Manager SHALL track storage usage, access patterns, and retention compliance
